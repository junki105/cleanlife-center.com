This plugin makes it easy to add Quicktags to the html - and visual-editor.

== Description ==
This plugin makes it easy to add Quicktags to the html - and visual-editor. It is possible to export your Quicktags as a JSON - file that can be imported in other installations of the plugin. 

WP-AddQuicktag for WordPress is originally created by [Roel Meurders](http://roel.meurders.nl/ "Roel Meurders"). The versions in the Repo of AddQuicktag are newer versions, this is a complete rewrite of version 2.0.0 with more functionality.

The plugin can add configurable custom quicktags to the editor of every post type, including custom post types from other sources. You may choose a post type for which a quicktag shall show up in the editor.
If this should not work perfectly well for you, you may also use the hooks inside the plugin. See the examples and hint inside the tab "[Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addquicktag/other_notes/)".

= Bugs, technical hints or contribute =
Please give me feedback, contribute and file technical bugs on [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bueltge/addquicktag). The Wiki on this page has also several hints for the plugin.

== Installation ==
= Requirements =
* WordPress version 4.0 and later (see _Compatible up to_)

= Installation =
1. Unpack the download-package
1. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or for the Network, if you will use in Multisite for all Sites
1. Got to 'Settings' menu and configure the plugin

== Screenshots ==
1. Settings area in WordPress 4.0-alpha
2. HTML Editor with new Quicktags
3. Visual editor with new Quicktags

== Other Notes ==
= Hook for custom post types =
The plugin adds the quicktag by default to post types/ID `post`, `page` and `comment`. To use the plugin for other post types also you may use a filter; see the following example or an example plugin in the [Gist 1595155](https://gist.github.com/1595155).

	// add custom function to filter hook 'addquicktag_post_types'
	add_filter( 'addquicktag_post_types', 'my_addquicktag_post_types' );
	/**
	 * Return array $post_types with custom post types
	 *
	 * @param   $post_type Array
	 * @return  $post_type Array
	 */
	function my_addquicktag_post_types( $post_types ) {

		$post_types[] = 'edit-comments';
		return $post_types;
	}


= Hook for custom pages =
It is possible also to filter the pages inside the backend. By default the scripts include the pages `post.php`, `comment.php`. The following example changes this for an another page.

	add_filter( 'addquicktag_pages', 'my_addquicktag_pages' );
	/**
	 * Return array $page with custom page strings
	 *
	 * @param   $page Array
	 * @return  $page Array
	 */
	function my_addquicktag_pages( $page ) {

		$page[] = 'edit-comments.php';
		return $page;
	}

See this Gist as an example for how to add the Quicktags to the editor of comments: [Gist: 3076698](https://gist.github.com/3076698).
If you want the Quicktags of this plugin to work on the Quickedit of comments as well, remove the `.example`-part of `addquicktag_quickedit_comment.php.example` filename. The file is a stand alone helper plugin for Add Quicktag. You'll need to activate this file (plugin) separately in 'Manage Plugins'.


= Hook for custom buttons =
It is possible to add custom buttons to the editor, if the plugin is active.

The following example adds buttons. The params inside the array are the same as in the settings of the plugin.

	if ( class_exists( 'Add_Quicktag' ) ) :
	add_filter( 'addquicktag_buttons', 'my_addquicktag_buttons' );

	function my_addquicktag_buttons( $buttons ) {

	    $buttons[] = array(
	        'text'          => 'Permalink',
	        'title'         => '',
	        'start'         => '[permalink]',
	        'end'           => '[/permalink]',
	        'access'        => '',
	        'order'         => 1,
	        'visual'        => 1,
	        'post'          => 0,
	        'page'          => 1,
	        'comment'       => 0,
	        'edit-comments' => 0
	    );
	    $buttons[] = array(
	        'text'          => 'Button',
	        'title'         => '',
	        'start'         => '<span class="border blue">',
	        'end'           => '</span>',
	        'access'        => '',
	        'order'         => 2,
	        'visual'        => 1,
	        'post'          => 0,
	        'page'          => 1,
	        'comment'       => 0,
	        'edit-comments' => 0
	    );
	    return $buttons;
	}
	endif;
