== Why this Plugin ==

The [IntelligenceWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/intelligence) project leverages the GADWP plugin for core Google Analytics integrations.

After the Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress changed maintainers in April 2018, users expressed concern over the new auth process proving 3rd party access to Google API keys and analytics data.

GAinWP implements a direct auth process where API keys only reside in your WordPress site eliminating 3rd party access.

The long term goal of the project is to provide an open, standards based Google Analytics WordPress API to facilitate integration of Google Analytics data by other plugins and themes into WordPress.
